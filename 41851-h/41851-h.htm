<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>In this book the subject of Copper Work, as it may be
introduced into the public schools, is treated to the
extent of specifying an equipment and suggesting some of
the possibilities of a course. Not only will there be found
an abundance of illustrative material on this subject, consisting
of drawings and photographs of various objects
executed by upper grammar and high school pupils, but also
a detailed description of the processes necessary for the
execution of many of the designs. It is not expected that
the problems as given will be slavishly copied, but rather
that they will make clear the methods and processes that
may be applied in the working out of similar problems. It
is hoped that this volume will be especially helpful to
teachers in the Manual Arts who are trying to introduce
Metal Work into the regular school course.</p>

<p>The author is indebted to Charles J. Martin and Antonio
Cirino, for valuable assistance in making some of the
illustrations.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_I" id="Chapter_I">Chapter I.</a></h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>


<p>During the past few years many experiments have
been tried in the development of Manual Training Courses
and much time has been spent in discussing of what lines
of work they should consist. Wood and iron were the first
materials used and are yet indispensable, but experience
has led those who are developing this work to believe that
there are other materials as well adapted to Manual Training
work in all its various forms. Clay, used not only for
modeling but for ceramic work as well, leather, brass and
copper are materials that have also been put to the test
and found satisfactory in many ways.</p>

<p>In ancient times copper was known as a useful metal,
and down through the ages it not only held its own but
increased in usefulness. Among its valuable properties may
be mentioned toughness and ductility; its toughness enables
it to be beaten into thin strong sheets, while its ductility
enables it to be drawn out into fine wire. Copper readily
forms important alloys, such as brass from copper and
zinc.</p>

<p>Work in sheet copper and brass has been introduced into
the public school course with gratifying results. It has
proved itself to be a valuable departure from other branches
of Manual Training work and gives promise of being permanent.
Sheet, copper and brass offer possibilities for
various kinds of treatment, either in the flat work which
includes saw piercing, embossing and enameling, or in the
raised work.</p>

<p>There is something about this work that appeals to
pupils and holds their interest. The nature of the material,
hard enough to offer some resistance and yet pliable enough
to allow its being wrought into many forms, the durability
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
of the object when completed, and the variety of colors
that may be obtained, especially with copper, all tend to
make the subject not only interesting but fascinating.</p>

<p>All exercises in sheet metal should be of some real
value to the pupil; no time should be spent on work done
simply for practice, but the various steps should be learned
in the making of useful objects of artistic worth. In this,
as in other work, it seems best to give each member of
the class the same work for a while until he has become
acquainted with the different tools and learned the limitations
of the material. When this has been accomplished,
each pupil may be allowed to work out his own designs.
In this the educational value is very greatly increased. The
pupil conceives the idea and makes several sketches of it,
carrying it through repeated changes until it is brought to
the perfected design appropriate in every way to the idea.
Some may not be fortunate enough to get a full equipment
so that all of the various kinds of metal work may be done,
but such may be able to make a beginning by doing light
work in saw piercing, which requires a very limited
equipment.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>


<h3>EQUIPMENT.</h3>

<p>The equipment necessary for a start in Copper work
need cost but little if the teacher is somewhat ingenious,
for the patterns of the various anvils may be made by him;
from these patterns the castings can be made at any
foundry for three or four cents per pound. It is better to
begin with a few anvils and tools and to add one or two at
a time as the need is felt for a more varied supply. If the
work can be done in a room already fitted with benches and
vises, it will reduce the first cost considerably. Any home-made
bench will do if a regulation one is not to be had.
One that has given satisfaction was made of 2" × 4" studding
with plank tops in lengths of 12 feet, giving space for
four vises at each bench. A swivel vise that may be turned
at any angle will be found satisfactory.</p>

<p>An annealing tray made of a piece of sheet iron in the
shape of a box about 18" square and 3" deep, with the corners
lapped and riveted and filled with slag, answers very well,
but one similar to the illustration, Figure 1, is better. In
this the top is circular and rotary, which is an advantage.
A pair of light long nose-tongs are needed to handle the
work. Any ordinary foot bellows and blow-pipe will do.</p>

<p>A box, Figure 2, large enough to hold two 2-gallon
stone jars and about half a bushel of sawdust, is needed.
One of the jars is for water in which the object is cooled
after being annealed; the other is for pickle which is used
to clean the work. The sawdust is used to dry the object
after it has been dipped in the water.</p>

<h3>MATERIALS.</h3>

<p>Copper is the material best suited for the work outlined
in this book, although the processes as described may be
applied to brass or silver. Brass may be used successfully
in the flat work, but for raised work copper is the best
material for the beginner.</p>

<p>Copper is obtainable in different thicknesses and in
various grades but the best grade should be used. For
most of the work from 18 to 24 gauge is used, while metal
from 12 to 18 gauge is used occasionally.</p>

<p>Copper wire is used in several sizes for making rivets.</p>

<p>No. 22 and 28 iron wire is indispensable for binding
when soldering.</p>

<p>Easy running silver solder may be made by the user,
but as a small piece will solder many joints, and as it is
not practical to make it in small quantities, it is better to
buy it ready made as desired.</p>

<p>Powdered or lump borax is used as a flux in soldering.
Charcoal or asbestos blocks are used when soldering small
work.</p>

<p>Cut-quick and rouge are used for polishing.</p>

<p>Nitric and sulphuric acids are used to clean work.</p>


<h4>PICKLE.</h4>

<p>Pickle is a trade name given to solutions used in
cleaning work. Different proportions of acids are used
according to the work to be cleaned. For copper and
silver a dilute bath of sulphuric acid is used of 1 part acid
to 15 parts of water. The solution may be used cold but
when used hot it becomes much more effective. When used
hot a copper dish is necessary. The object being placed
in the dish with enough pickle to cover it, it is then placed
over a gas plate and allowed to come to boiling heat. The
pickle is then poured off and the object rinsed in clean
water. A dilute solution of nitric acid is used for brass.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>


<h4>GAUGE.</h4>

<p>Gauge, as referred to in this book, is a term used to
denote the thickness of sheet metal. The Standard Wire
Gauge is divided in gauge numbers from 5 to 36; and is
used for measuring the thickness of wire and sheet metal.
It is usually a plate of steel having round its edge a series
of notches of standard openings.</p>

<h3>PROBLEMS.</h3>


<h3>ESCUTCHEONS.</h3>

<p>Escutcheons may be made of any metal; but copper,
brass, and iron are most used. The size and shape of the
escutcheon are determined by the size of the lock and the
space at our disposal. The outline may be circular, square
or rectangular, or it may be modified somewhat, care being
taken to keep it in harmony with its surroundings.</p>

<p>First make a careful drawing of the design. Take a
piece of metal a little larger than the drawing calls for, and
of the desired gauge, from 12 to 20 gauge is all right for
such an exercise. The design is then transferred to the
metal by the use of carbon paper, or a tracing is made on
rice paper from the drawing and pasted on the metal. Then
take a metal saw (No. 2 or 3) and saw about the design
<a href="#Figure_8">Figure 8</a>, <a href="#Figure_8A">8A</a>. To saw the key whole, a hole must be drilled
through which the saw can be placed to follow the line.
Before drilling use a center punch, making a slight depression
as a start for the drill. After the sawing is completed, a
file is used to true up the outline and to smooth the edges.
The holes for the nails are next drilled. After using a little
emery paper about the edges, it is ready to finish.</p>

<div class="pmb1"></div>

<p>The metal, as it comes from the rolling mill, is perfectly
smooth. If, in this piece of work, it is desired to make the
surface a little more interesting, it may be done by taking
any hammer with a smooth domed face and going over the
surface. This, however, should be done before sawing. As
the hammering stretches the metal somewhat, if it is left
till after the sawing is done, it means more filing to get the
design into shape. For a beginning this exercise has proved
very satisfactory, as it gives the pupil an acquaintance with
the metal and uses but a small piece of material.</p>


<h3>HINGE TAILS.</h3>

<p>These plates represent suggestive designs for hinges and
may be given among first exercises in sawing; when so used,
they should be treated like the escutcheon already described.</p>

<p>Pulls generally consist of two parts, the handle and
the plate to which the handle is fastened. Some pulls are
stationary as in <a href="#Figure_9">Figures 9</a>, <a href="#Figure_10">10</a>, while in others the handle
swings from either one or two points, <a href="#Figure_11">Figures 11</a>, <a href="#Figure_12">12</a>, <a href="#Figure_13">13</a>. In
this case the handle may be made by taking a rod as great
in diameter as the thickest part of the handle, and either
drawing it out by hammering or filing it down to the required
taper. After it is tapered to the required size as at <a href="#Figure_14">Figures 14</a>,
it is then bent into shape according to the design. If
the handle is to swing from one or two points, it should be
fastened by any one of the following methods.</p>

<p>Method 1. If it is possible to have the handle support go
through the drawer or door, the support may be made from a
piece of square rod of the length desired, a hole being drilled
through one end, the size needed, as at Figure 15<a href="#Figure_15">Figure 15</a>, A. A
shoulder is then made by filing the rod down to the size of the
hole in the plate. In making the shoulder the remainder of
the rod which is to go through the drawer front may be left
square or filed round; as the hole is round that is drilled
to receive it, this last is the better way. It is also easier to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
fasten it on the inside of the drawer when it is made in this
way, for it may be simply headed up as in making a rivet,
Figure 15 B, or a thread may be cut and a nut used, Figure
15 C, D. The latter method is better where taps and dies
are at hand. When it is fastened by riveting, a circular or
square piece of metal called a washer, Figure 15 E, a little
larger in diameter than the bolt, with a hole the size of the
bolt, is placed next to the drawer front on the inside; this
makes the riveting more secure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

  Figure 15.</span><br />
  </span>
</div>
<div class="pmb1"></div>


<p>Method 2. Another method for fastening this style of
a handle is to cut a slot through the plate about 1/16 inch wide
and length called for by the design, <a href="#Figure_16A">Figure 16 A</a>. Then
take a strip of copper in length 7 times the diameter of the
handle end and as wide as the slot in the plate is long,
<a href="#Figure_16B">Figure 16 B</a>. This is then bent circular a little larger in
diameter than the end of handle as at <a href="#Figure_16C">Figure 16 C</a>, and
placed in the slot as at <a href="#Figure_16D">Figure 16 D</a>, and clinched on the back
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of the plate as at <a href="#Figure_16E">Figure 16 E</a>. The plate is in this case
fastened to the drawer or door by nailing or riveting.</p>

  <span class="caption"><span style="font-size:.8em">
  Figure 16.</span><br />
  </span>
</div>
<div class="pmb1"></div>

<p>Method 3. When it is desirable to make the plate and
handle support all in one piece, it may be done in any one of
three ways. First. By allowing enough metal in the center
of the plate to form the handle support as at <a href="#Figure_12">Figure 12</a>.
Second. By allowing metal at the top of the plate to bend
over handle as at <a href="#Figure_11">Figure 11</a>. Third. By allowing metal at
the sides to be turned up at right angles to the plate to form
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the support as at <a href="#Figure_13">Figure 13</a>. In this case holes are drilled in
the side pieces and a rivet is put through from one side to
the other to hold the handle. For this one the handle must
be either bent around the rivet or drilled to receive the rivet.
In all three of these cases the plate is fastened to the door
or drawer by nailing or riveting.</p>


<h3>HINGES.</h3>

<p>
<a href="#Plate_13">Plate 13</a>, Various outlines of the same hinge.<br />
<a href="#Plate_14">Plate 14</a>, Hinges of same outline with interior variations.<br />
<a href="#Plate_15">Plates 15</a>, <a href="#Plate_16">16</a>, <a href="#Plate_17">17</a>, Butt and Strap Hinges.<br />
</p>

<p>In a hinge, the joint is the important feature. The
size of the hinge, the strength required, and the decoration
must also receive attention. After these have been determined,
a drawing should be made giving a development of the
joint. Whatever the size of the hinge, the following principle
in regard to the joint must be kept in mind. There
must be alternating projections left on the inner ends of
each leaf of the hinge to fit into one another so that the
pin may pass through them and allow the hinge to swing.
The method of making these projections is determined by the
size of the hinge.</p>

<p>In hinges of any considerable size, the projections are
left attached to the hinge proper; in allowing for them there
will be an even number on one leaf and an odd number on
the other. To obtain the strength desired, the width of the
projections on one leaf should equal the width of the
projections on the other leaf. This applies to any number
of projections. Their length should be determined by the
diameter of the joint, three times the diameter is the
approximate length.</p>

<p>In making small hinges the projections may be bent
into position by the use of the round nose plyers. In
larger work the projection is fastened in the vise and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
beginning at the end is bent around the pin a little at a
time using the raw-hide mallet to work it into shape.</p>

<p>For small joints or hinges, such as would be used on a
match box, stamp box, bon-bon box, or ink pot, the joint
should be made of small tubing as described on page <a href="#Page_110">110</a>.
This tubing is sawed into the required lengths and soldered
to the leaves to be hinged. The parts to receive the joint
are sometimes filed out.</p>

<h3>FINGER PLATES.</h3>


<p>The finger plate used on the edge of a door to receive
the wear of the hand serves as an excellent exercise in
sawing and filing. The design is transferred to the metal
by use of carbon paper. The sawing is done as in the
escutcheon. The surface may be left smooth or it may
be gone over with a hammer having a face somewhat
rounded. If the design calls for any repousse work, it is
done as described on page <a href="#Page_74">74</a>.</p>

<h3>PAD CORNERS.</h3>

<p>Desk pad corners while not difficult to make, are very
useful as well as ornamental. The design may be carried
out in any one of three ways: pierced, embossed or enameled.</p>

<p>In making the pattern for the pad corner, an allowance
must be made for the thickness of the pad, as at A, and also
for laps as at B, that are to go under the pad to hold the
corners in place. The corner may be riveted to the pad at
the back or the laps may be bent in such a way as to clamp
them to the pad, and permit of their removal at any time.</p>

<p>When the design has been pierced or embossed, the
laps can be bent over a piece of metal equal in thickness
to that of the pad. If the design is to be carried out in
enamel, all bending must be done before enameling as any
expansion or contraction of the metal will crack the enamel.</p>

<h3>BOX CORNERS.</h3>

<p>Box corners serve primarily to protect the corners of the
box and to increase its strength, but they can be so made
that they give character to the box. The corner should be
designed to suit the particular box or chest to which it is to
be applied. The method of making a box corner is slightly
different from those previously described. After the design
has been drawn, a pattern made from it in heavy paper
will be found helpful, for this pattern may be used to mark
out the design on the metal. In this way irregularities in
the design are less likely to occur than when the design is
transferred with the carbon paper directly to the metal.
The decoration may be pierced or embossed, according
to one's choice. After the sawing or embossing has been
done, it should be filed carefully and smoothed up with fine
emery cloth to do away with crude and sharp edges.</p>

<p>The holes for the rivets are then drilled and the burr
that is made by drilling is removed with a larger drill. The
two edges, A A. <a href="#Page_51">Plate 21</a>, that are to come together when in
place on the box should be beveled a little so that they will
form a better corner. After this is done, the sides are bent
down over a block of wood or metal placed in the vise.
A rawhide hammer should be used to avoid marks on the
face of the corner. In this as in other work, if it is desired
that the metal have a hammered surface, the effect must
be given before the design is cut out.</p>

<p>Suitable rivets are next made as described on page <a href="#Page_108">108</a>
and illustrated on page <a href="#Page_109">109</a>. After being colored or polished
the corner is ready to be applied to the box.</p>

<h3>STAMP BOXES.</h3>

<p>Stamp boxes may be made in various ways, three of
which are described below:</p>

<p>Box No. 1 and 2, <a href="#Plate_23">Plate 23</a>.</p>

<p>On a piece of 20 gauge metal, lay out or draw the pattern
as shown on the plate; first with pencil, then with a scratch
awl to insure permanency, going over the lines lightly on
the metal. By the use of a saw frame and a No. 3 saw the
corners of the square are cut out.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
 <a name="Figure_18" id="Figure_18"></a>
  <img src="images/i_053.jpg" width="400" height="356" alt="Stamp Box." title="" />
  <span class="caption"><span style="font-size:.8em">
  Figure 18.</span><br />
  </span>
</div>
<div class="pmb1"></div>

<p>The edges that form the corners are next filed up,
keeping all edges straight and at right angles; after this,
the edges are beveled a little, forming a mitre which,
when soldered, makes a better joint than otherwise.</p>

<p>The sides are next bent up over an iron block placed in
the vise as at Figure 18. The corners should be brought
well together, using a rawhide hammer, No. 1, <a href="#Plate_2">Plate 2</a>.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 501px;">
 <a name="Plate_23" id="Plate_23"></a>
  <img src="images/i_054.jpg" width="501" height="700" alt="Stamp Box." title="" />
  <span class="caption"><span style="font-size:.8em">
  Plate 23.</span><br />
  </span>
</div>
<div class="pmb1"></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>A piece of iron wire about No. 24 is then placed around
the box and twisted tight enough to hold the corners in
place while being soldered, <a href="#Figure_19">Figure 19</a>. Borax and solder
are next applied and the soldering done as described on page
63. In this case, however, all of the corners should be
prepared at the same time for soldering. If but one corner
is prepared and soldered, the heat necessary for soldering
causes the copper oxides to come to the surface at the other
corners which must be removed before they can be soldered.
This is remedied by coating with borax and placing the solder
at all corners before applying any heat.</p>

<div class="pmb1"></div>

<p>After the soldering is done the box is pickled. Surplus
solder is next removed by filing. The box is again placed
over the iron block which is held in the vise; the corners
and bottom edges are squared up, using the round end of
hammer shown at No. 2, <a href="#Plate_2">Plate 2</a>, and the top is filed off
level. This completes the body part of the box.</p>

<p>The cover is made in the same way as the box. Much
care must be taken to have the pattern carefully and
accurately drawn so that when the cover is finished it will
fit closely to the body. The design, if there is any, whether
it is embossed or enamelled, must be carried out before
cutting it to size.</p>

<p>Box No. 2, although of different proportion, is made
in the same way as No. 1.</p>

<p>Box No. 3, <a href="#Plate_24">Plate 24</a>.</p>

<p>Take a strip of metal as wide as the required depth
of the box and as long as the sum of the four sides. The
length of each side is measured off on this strip and a line
scratched at right angles to the edge. The strip is then
placed over a block of metal and, with a rawhide hammer
bent at right angles at scratched lines, making three
corners, leaving the ends to meet at the fourth corner where
they are to be soldered. These ends should be mitered as in
Box 1, before soldering. After the corner has been soldered
and the box pickled, it is again placed over a block and trued
up square. Having decided which is to be the top and
which the bottom of the box, file the bottom edges level and
at right angles to the sides. A piece of metal is then cut
for the bottom large enough to allow about 1/16" to project
on all four sides.</p>

<p>It is then prepared for soldering and bound together
with iron wire, <a href="#Page_55">Figure 20</a>. The solder should be cut in
small pieces and placed about the inside edges. In soldering
the bottom, care must be taken not to unsolder the corner.
This may be avoided by keeping the flame away from the
soldered corner until the rest of the solder has run, applying
it to the corner at the last and only for a fraction of a
minute.</p>

<p>After the soldering, the box is pickled and the edges of
the bottom filed square. The 1/16" that was allowed to project
may be filed flush with the sides of the box or left to
project a little.</p>

<p>The cover is made by taking a strip of metal about 3/16"
wide and long enough to fit around the inside of the box.
The length of the sides (inside measurement) is laid out
and then bent over a block as previously described. The
corner is soldered and the upper edges are filed off level
and soldered to a piece of metal, forming the top. This
strip on the inside keeps the cover in place. If the design
on the cover is to be carried out in enamel it should be
done after the cover is completed. If the design is to be
embossed, it should be done before the strip which holds
the cover in place is soldered on.</p>

<p>Box No. 4, <a href="#Page_56">Plate 24</a>.</p>

<p>The body of this box may be made like either No. 1
or No. 3. An addition is shown on this one which allows
the stamp to be taken from the box more easily. A strip
of 20 gauge metal 1/16" wide is soldered on the inside next
to the top edge extending from one end to the other as
shown in the section at D. Another piece of the same gauge
metal is cut, in length equal to the inside length of the box
and about 1/4" wider than the box. This is placed inside
the box and sprung into place as shown at C in the section.
This device may be applied to either of the other boxes.</p>

<p>The cover of this box is made of but one piece and
hinged with a strap hinge, which also forms the cover
decoration.</p>

<p>To give the surface of the metal of this box a bold
hammered surface adds much to its attractiveness.</p>


<h3>MATCH BOX.</h3>

<p>The Match Box may be made in the same way as the
Stamp Box with the exception of the cover. It seems better
to have the cover of the match box hinged. The hinge
may be made so as to form a part of the decoration of the
cover by making it a strap hinge as shown at <a href="#Page_42">Plates 15</a>, <a href="#Page_43">16</a>,
<a href="#Page_44">17</a>. The hinge may also be made of tubing and extend
across the back of the box. This method leaves the cover
to be decorated in some other way, either by embossing or
by enameling or by both.</p>

<h3>SCONCE A.</h3>


<p>The pattern for this sconce as shown at <a href="#Page_42">Plate 29A</a> is
transferred to the metal which is then cut out. The part
which serves as a reflector is raised by placing the metal face
down on a sand bag, or on pitch and with the pein end of a
chaser's hammer or with a pointed horn hammer, driving the
center down to the required depth. If the face is somewhat
irregular, it can be trued up by placing it on a block of
wood and going over it with a rawhide hammer.</p>

<p>The shelf on which the candle socket rests is formed
by bending the lower part of the sconce at right angles as
shown by the dotted line. The projections at 2, 3, 4, <a href="#Page_65">Plate 29 A</a>,
when bent into shape as shown on <a href="#Page_64">Plate 29</a> form the
supports for the candle socket. The projection at 5 <a href="#Page_65">Plate 29 A</a> when bent into shape serves as a bracket to support the
shelf. The candle socket is made from a strip of metal bent
into cylindrical shape with the ends riveted together. When
the socket has been riveted and holes drilled as indicated, the
sconce is finished according to taste and mounted on a back
of wood stained to harmonize with the color of the metal.</p>

<h3>SCONCE B.</h3>

<p>A rectangular piece of metal is cut out about 1/2 inch
larger on all sides than the design calls for and given a
hammered surface with the pein end of a large hammer.
After the design has been transferred to the back of the
metal, it is then placed on pitch face down, and with a
suitable tool the lines are sunk at A and B, <a href="#Page_68">Plate 31</a>, about
1/16", as shown in the section at C. It is then removed
from the pitch and, after cleaning, is put over a sand bag
face up, and with a rawhide hammer, the part that is to
serve as a reflector is concaved a little.</p>

<p>The candle socket is made like the pattern as shown at
D. It is bent cylindrical in shape and the ends are riveted
together, then the laps on either side are bent nearly at right
angles and serve to hold the socket in place. The cup is
made from a circular piece of metal hammered into a slightly
conical shape, E. A rod the length required is bent at right
angles with a shoulder left at each end. The bracket is
made next like the pattern F and bent into shape as at G.</p>

<p>When all the parts are finished, they are put together.
Place the rod in a vise with the short end up. The cup is
put over the pin at H, and also the socket, so that the pin
passes through the holes in both laps. The pin is then
headed up, holding all securely in place. The bracket is
next riveted to the back at K, through which the rod is put,
the pin passing through the back is headed up at L. After
finishing, the sconce may be mounted on a wood back.</p>

<h3>PICTURE FRAME.</h3>

<p>This object is made as follows: Take a piece of metal
quite a little larger than the outline of the frame that is
to be made. Draw on this piece of metal the outline of the
frame and also the extensions which are folded back to give
the thickness necessary for the reception of the picture,
glass, and back, as shown at B. Have the side opposite to
that on which the drawing is done free from scratches as it is
to serve later as the front. Any decoration that is used
must be of the simplest sort. This decoration may be pierced
or in repousse. The frame here illustrated and the plate of
designs were intended for repousse as more satisfactory
results have been obtained by this process. After the
design for the decoration of the front of the frame has been
transferred to the same side of the metal as the outline,
it must be prepared for the repousse process. This is done
by placing it on a pitch pot. The pitch is softened enough
so that the metal will stick to it. After placing the metal on
the pitch, work a little of the pitch over the edges as this
will hold it more securely. It is then allowed to cool or
harden before working. With a suitable tool and hammer,
after the pitch is hard, follow the lines which make up the
design or decorative part of the frame. The lines should be
gone over lightly, slowly, and carefully at first until the
design is fairly well started; then they may be gone over
again, sinking them a little deeper each time until they
have been carried deep enough to give the design the required
relief on the face of the frame. For this part of the
work the tool should not be used as a punch, driving the
metal down in one place and then moving it to another and
so on, but it should be kept moving all the time and should
at the same time receive a repeated number of light blows
from the hammer. By so doing the face of the work will
be smooth, otherwise each blow from the hammer will show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>If there is doubt as to the depth to which the lines should
be carried, the work may be taken off the pitch occasionally,
so that the face may be seen. It is not an easy thing to
reduce relief in this work, therefore it is better to go carefully
working it up slowly. After the repousse part of the frame
is done, clean it with kerosene and pickle.</p>

<p>The corners may then be cut out as at B, filed up
square, and beveled as in the box. The sides are then
bent back over a block of wood or metal, bringing the
corners well together. They are then soldered. A metal
saw is used to make the opening, A, the edges of which
are then filed up square.</p>

<p>The back for this frame is made in the same way as
the front except that it is left perfectly plain. This should
be made to fit inside of the frame tight enough so that no
fastening will be needed to hold it in place.</p>

<p>A frame of this size and kind may be made to hang or
to stand. If it is to hang, a small ring may be made and
fastened to the back as shown at C. If it is to stand, a
support of some kind such as is shown at D is needed. This
is made of the same thickness metal as the frame and may
be made in many outlines. This support may be made stationary
by riveting it to the back, or hinged, which is much
better, as is shown at E and F. The hinge is made by
taking a piece of about 1/8" tubing and cutting three pieces,
making one of the pieces equal in width to the other two and
having the three equal in width to the top of the support.
The two short pieces are soldered to the back and the long
piece to the support. A piece of wire equal in diameter to
the hole in the tube is then cut and put in place which
hinges the back and support together.</p>

<p>The method of making the tubing used for the above
is described on page <a href="#Page_110">110</a>.</p>

<h3>SOLDERING.</h3>

<p>A piece of silver solder, a slate slab such as is ordinarily
used for grinding ink, powdered or lump borax, and a soft
hair brush of some sort are all that is necessary for the
process of soldering in addition to what we already have.</p>

<p>The pieces of metal that are to be soldered must be
absolutely free from all foreign matter. To insure this the
joint is scraped bright with some sharpe-edged tool. Care
must be taken to keep the fingers away from the joint as
any moisture or greasy substance will prevent the solder
from running. The best results are obtained only by being
extremely careful as to cleanliness throughout the process.
Being sure that the slab is perfectly clean, a little water is
put in it and the lump of borax is ground around until the
water becomes like thin cream. If powdered borax is
used a block of wood will answer as a pestle to grind the
borax to the right consistency.</p>

<p>The solder may be obtained any gauge, but about 20
answers for most purposes. After cutting the solder into
pieces about 1/16 of an inch long and about the same width,
drop them into the borax that has been ground to give them
a coating of borax and to remove any grease that may have
adhered to them. Coat the surfaces that are to be soldered
with the borax being careful to get no more borax about
than is necessary. Put the parts together and bind them
with No. 24 iron wire, not too tightly. The pieces of solder
are then lifted with the brush used for the borax or with a
pair of tweezers and placed next to the edge that is to be
soldered, about one inch apart. The object is then placed
on the annealing tray, which answers for soldering as well,
and with the blow-pipe it is heated, very slowly at first until
the water has evaporated and the borax crystallized and
dissolved, the flame may then be applied more directly and
the object brought to a soldering heat. If the heat is applied
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
too quickly, it will throw off the solder; and if heated
hotter than necessary it is liable to melt or burn the parts
being soldered, so the process demands the closest attention
from the start.</p>

<p>The object is then pickled, washed in clear water and
dried in the sawdust.</p>

<p>If the above directions are carefully followed good
results may be expected.</p>


<h3>REPOUSSE OR EMBOSSING.</h3>

<p>Repousse or embossing involves practically the same
principle as modeling in clay or wax, the only difference
being that metal is used as the material and that different
tools are employed. In this, as in clay or wax work, it is
desirable to bring certain parts of a design into relief; to do
this with metal the work must be placed on a substance
which will give some resistance and yet allow each blow
of the hammer or tool to make an impression. The substance
commonly used for this purpose has the following
composition, in the proportions given:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Black pitch           1 lb.<br />
Tallow                3 teaspoonfuls.<br />
Plaster of Paris      1/2 cup.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The pitch is put in some kind of dish (agate is good),
placed over a gas plate, and melted. The tallow is then
added and the plaster sprinkled and stirred in, the whole
being well mixed. It is then poured into the pitch pot, or
whatever it is to be used in. When used in hot weather
more plaster must be used. A pot, hemispherical in shape,
<a href="#Page_76">Figure 21</a>, made of cast iron about &frac12; inch thick is generally
used. This, when placed on a chaser's pad or ring, Figure 21,
may be turned at any angle, and is found to be a great
convenience. An ordinary 7" × 12" baking pan of iron
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
serves the purpose, or a box may be made of wood, but
of course this is not so durable.</p>

<p>After allowing the composition to cool partly, yet
while soft enough to stick, the piece of work that is to be
embossed is placed on it, the right side next to the pitch.
It is then allowed to cool still more; when quite hard or
when it is difficult to make an impression on it with the
thumb nail, it is ready to work on. The design is next
drawn or transferred to the metal by the use of carbon paper
and then scratched on with a scratch awl to make the
drawing more permanent, as in going over the piece of
work the pencil or carbon lines are easily erased.</p>

<p>The tools necessary for this work may be made as
needed according to each individual design. There are a
few general ones that are always found useful, such as
those shown at <a href="#Page_19">Figure 5</a>. <a href="#Page_76">Figure 22</a> shows a hammer
generally used for this work.</p>

<h3>RAISED FORMS.</h3>


<p>The first exercise in raising should be a form quite
simple in outline, <a href="#Page_78">Plate 34 A</a>. A drawing or blue print
should be used showing the shape and dimensions and this
should be worked to as closely as possible. Next select a
piece of copper suitable in thickness for an object of this
size, in this case 20 gauge. The metal for raising must be
circular in shape and the diameter of the piece needed for
this bowl determined in the following way:</p>

<p>Take a piece of string, place it on the drawing or blue
print, starting in the center of the base, and follow the
curve as indicated at A, on <a href="#Page_78">Plate 34</a>. This will give the
radius needed for describing the circle, which is 5-1/2". The
circle is then cut out with the shears, after which another
circle is described on the metal for the base. All lines
made on the metal should be made quite lightly.</p>

<p>As a rule the copper comes from the rolling mill somewhat
hardened so the next thing to do is to soften it by a
process called annealing.</p>

<p>Place upon the annealing tray, <a href="#Page_13">Figure 1</a>, the circular
piece of metal already cut, and apply the flame from the
blow-pipe upon it until it becomes red hot. It is either
allowed to cool off gradually or dipped in cold water and
then dried in the sawdust.</p>

<p>Select an anvil the shape of which conforms somewhat
to the outline of the bowl and also to the curve of the base.
It is often necessary to use several anvils to complete an
object, but a little experience will help to decide which
should be used first. The No. 1 anvil on <a href="#Page_15">Plate 1</a> seems to
be about what is needed for this particular piece of work.</p>

  </span>
</div>
<div class="pmb1"></div>


<p>The anvil is placed in the vise and the metal held in
the left hand against the anvil so that the end of the anvil
comes directly under the circle which represents the base,
as shown at <a href="#Page_79">Figure 23</a>. With a raising hammer, No. 3 on
<a href="#Page_17">Plate 2</a>, begin hammering with light blows at first, following
the circle closely the first time around until the base is well
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
started. This operation is continued at each turn striking
a little above the previous blows until the top is reached
when it will take the shape as shown at <a href="#Page_79">Figure 24</a>. Sometimes
a horn or box-wood mallet is used to start a piece
of work. As the hammering hardens the metal it is
necessary to anneal it each time after going over the
surface. After this is done, we proceed as at first until
the required form is obtained as called for by the drawing.</p>

<p>Care must be taken not to stretch the metal any more
than can be helped as the more it is stretched the thinner
it becomes.</p>

<p>The surface and outline of the bowl left by the raising
hammer is quite irregular and needs to be trued up by a
process called planishing; for this a No. 2 or 4 hammer, Plate
2, with a polished face and somewhat broader than the
raising hammer is used. By going over the surface with
this hammer all irregularities are removed leaving a refined
curve and a finished surface.</p>

<p>If the bottom gets a little out of shape during the operation
of raising, it can be easily brought back again by using
a No. 2 stake, Plate 1, and a No. 5 hammer, <a href="#Page_17">Plate 2</a>.</p>

<p>During the raising process the top edge has also become
very irregular and must now be trimmed off level. Place
the bowl on some level surface (a surface plate will give
the best results) and with the point in the surface gauge
describe a line about the top making it the desired height,
<a href="#Page_82">Figure 25</a>. A small pair of shears is then used to trim off
the top to the line, after which a file is used to finish the
edge, leaving it perfectly smooth. A piece of fine emery
cloth may be used at the last.</p>

<p>The principle of raising as here described applies to
forms of all sorts with few variations. Where a form is to
be raised with the top edge turned in as at B, <a href="#Page_78">Plate 34</a>, an
anvil similar to the outline must be used. In raising a
form like C, <a href="#Page_78">Plate 34</a>, the sides are carried up as shown by
the dotted lines and then the form is reversed and the
neck part drawn in. A deep form is raised more quickly
if, at the start, the metal is placed on a crinkling block
and the edge crinkled.</p>

  </span>
</div>
<div class="pmb1"></div>


<p>In all raised work after one becomes acquainted with
the material, it will be found that the metal can be forced
in any direction, giving thickness at the bottom, at the sides,
or at the rim, as is necessary.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>After raising a form like C, <a href="#Page_78">Plate 34</a>, it may be desired
to increase the diameter a little at o-o, where an anvil
cannot be used; or, if the form is satisfactory it may be
necessary to raise certain parts of it to carry out the decoration
called for by the design. This is done by the use of
the snarling-iron, made as illustrated at <a href="#Page_84">Figure 26</a>, which
shows the general outline only, as the ends vary in form
according to the work they are to do. One arm of the iron
is held in the vise as at <a href="#Page_85">Figure 27</a>. The form is then placed
over the end and held with the left hand while, with a
hammer in the right hand, the iron is struck quite near
the end in the vise which causes the other end to rebound.
This serves the same purpose as a direct blow from a hammer,
except that it works much more slowly.</p>

<h3>PORRINGER.</h3>


<p>The making of a porringer serves as a very interesting
exercise; and it is so simple in form that it can be raised after
very little experience. A suitable handle must also be
designed, sawed out and soldered to the body.</p>

<p>After the bowl has been raised into shape according to
the design, the top is cut and filed off level. When the
handle has been sawed out and the edges trued up, it is
fitted to the bowl part. Mark on the edge of the bowl the
place where the handle is to be fitted and fit it at that
place. The edge of the bowl where the handle is to be
soldered should be filed or scraped bright before the soldering
process is begun.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

  Figure 28.</span><br />
  </span>
</div>
<div class="pmb1"></div>


<p>Invert bowl and handle and lay them upon a level block
of charcoal, as shown at <a href="#Page_88">Figure 28</a>. Four or five wire nails
or pieces of iron wire forced into the charcoal keep the
handle and bowl together. The borax is applied and sufficient
solder to make a good joint. Use no more solder
than is necessary, as it will have to be removed by filing
and the less filing that is done about such a joint the better
the work will be. After the exercise has cooled, it may be
pickled, washed and dried.</p>

<p>While the heat is being applied for soldering, the bowl
is at the same time annealed and becomes so soft that it
is easily bent out of shape. The bowl of course must be
hardened again; this is done by placing it on an anvil
that conforms to the outline of the bowl and hammered
lightly over the surface. The handle is also treated in the
same way.</p>

<p>Any necessary filing or finishing is now done and the
porringer is ready to be polished.</p>

<p>If we choose, the handle may be riveted on, or it may
be made of the same piece as the bowl by allowing enough
metal where the handle is to be, to be bent back when the
bowl is raised into shape.</p>

<h3>TRAYS OR PLATES.</h3>

<p>Trays or plates may be made by working the bowl part
over an anvil or by driving it into a sand bag until the
required depth is obtained, or a form may be turned out of
a block of wood and the metal driven into it. After the
bowl part has been shaped it may be placed on the pitch
block and the outline trued up with a chasing tool. The
edge of the tray or plate may be decorated either by
piercing, embossing, etching, or enameling.</p>

<h3>INK POT.</h3>


<p>This exercise is carried out as follows: A form is first
raised like the lower part of the pot inverted, which is
nothing more than a bowl so far. A hole with a diameter
a little less than the diameter of the ink well is then sawed
with a piercing saw in the bottom of this bowl, as at A.
After this a circular piece of metal is cut equal in diameter
to the top of this bowl plus 1/4 of an inch, and soldered on
G. By making this piece 1/4 inch greater than the diameter
of the bowl, the soldering process becomes much easier.
After the soldering is finished, the projecting edges may be
filed off to the edge of the bowl. The bowl is then inverted
so that it rests on its greatest diameter H, and it becomes
an ink pot.</p>

<p>The cover, J, is made by taking a circular piece of metal
and raising the sides in the same way as in the bowl except
that the design calls for the sides at right angles to the
base. The curve is obtained by placing it on a sand bag
and driving it out from the inside to the required height.
From a strip of copper 20 gauge and 3/16 inch wide, C,
make a ring, D, equal in diameter to the inside of the
cover. Solder the ends of the ring together and, after shaping
it over a circular stake, fit and solder it to the base, as
shown in the section at E.</p>

<p>This keeps the cover in place. The knob, K, on the
cover is made of two hemispheres, L, by use of the dapping
block and tools, <a href="#Page_20">Figures 7</a> and <a href="#Page_94">29</a>. The two pieces are soldered
together, filed or finished about the joint, and soldered to
the cover, F. After dipping the different parts in the pickle,
then washing them in clean water, and doing a little filing
here and there about the joints to remove surplus solder,
the ink pot is ready for finishing. This may be done by
polishing, bronzing, or oxidizing.</p>

<p>The ink well proper should be made so that it may be
removed. It should be of glass or some other material
easily cleansed.</p>

<h3>SEALING WAX SET.</h3>

<h4>THE WAX POT.</h4>

<p>The wax pot is raised into shape as described in
Chapter VI on raised forms. Instead of cutting the top off
level, a nose is formed as shown at A, <a href="#Page_100">Plate 45</a>, which will
pour well. A handle is designed, sawed out, and riveted
on at the position indicated at B.</p>


<h4>THE LAMP.</h4>

<p>The body of the lamp is made by raising a bowl to
conform with the design; after cutting a hole in the bottom
it is inverted, C, and the bottom is soldered on at D. A
shallow cup is raised, E, a hole cut in the bottom to allow
for the lamp proper, and soldered to the body. Legs as
shown at F, and held together by a strip, H, are riveted to
the side of the body at G; on these the wax pot rests. The
lamp proper or alcohol well, which is filled with asbestos, is
raised with the edges turned out, as at N, which hold it in
place as shown in the section at J. The part at K serves as
a burner and is placed loosely in the cup, E, allowing its
removal at any time.</p>


<h4>SEAL.</h4>

<p>A monogram, letter or design of some sort must first
be decided on. When this has been done, the design is
transferred and scratched on a piece of 22 or 24 gauge
copper. If the design has a right and wrong to it, the
reverse should be transferred to the metal so that, when
stamped, the right side will appear. The copper is then
placed on the pitch and when cool enough to work upon,
the lines are followed with a chasing tool, sinking them to
the required depth. Care must be taken to avoid sharp
edges or any undercutting, if the seal is to free itself easily
from the wax. A handle for the seal may be made of wood
as shown on the plate; the seal is cut and attached as shown
at Section on L. M.</p>

<h3>WATCH FOB.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
 <a name="Figure_b9" id="Figure_b9"></a>
  <img src="images/i_101.jpg" width="80" height="263" alt="Illustration" title="" />
</div>
<div class="pmb1"></div>

<p>There are many ways of making watch fobs.
A very simple one is made as follows: First
make a drawing of the fob with some suitable
pendant as at A, <a href="#Page_102">Plate 46</a>. The pendant design
is next transferred to a piece of 12 gauge copper,
then sawed out and filed into shape. This must
be done with perhaps more care than on larger
work as it is to be more closely scrutinized.
The parts of the fob must be made to conform
with the width of the ribbon that is to be used.
A bar must be made for the top, wide enough
for the ribbon to be passed through and fastened.
This bar is made by cutting a slot in
a piece of metal of the same gauge as the
pendant, or by bending a piece of wire around a piece
of metal about 1/16 of an inch thick and the width of
the ribbon, making the ends meet in the centre of one of
the long sides. If more than one of these pieces is needed,
the wire is wound around the metal as many times as there
are pieces required and sawed apart. The ends are then bent
to come in line with each other and soldered. The piece is
again placed over the metal and, with a rawhide hammer,
worked into shape. The links that connect the bar and the
swivel are made as all links are made. Take a piece of
iron or steel wire the size required and also a piece of copper;
place one end of the steel wire and one end of the copper
wire in a vise so that the steel wire stands vertical. Then
wind the copper wire around the steel wire spirally with as
many turns as there are links required. Now take it out of
the vise and slip it off the steel wire, which leaves it in the
shape of a spring. Hold it with the thumb and forefinger
of the left hand and, resting it against the bench pin, saw
the links off with a fine saw one at a time until there are as
many as needed.</p>

<p>One of these links is soldered to the bar that
holds the ribbon and one to the top of the pendant;
the others are linked together to form the short
chain at the top. To connect the pendant to the
ribbon, two larger links are needed which are made
in the same way as the small ones. All the links
may be soldered or not. The links that are
soldered to the bar and to the pendant should be
filed flat a little to make the point of contact
greater. This insures a more secure joint. When
soldering such small pieces the charcoal block
is indispensable, for depressions are easily made
in it where necessary. The parts are placed on the block
in position and a small mouth blow-pipe is used; with this
the flame can be more delicately applied.</p>

</div>
<div class="pmb1"></div>

<p>When the different parts are completed,
they are pickled, rinsed, dried, and polished, and
then put together with the ribbon.</p>

<p>Fobs are sometimes made entirely of metal
as B, <a href="#Page_102">Plate 46</a>. In this slots are sawed in three
or more bars of metal which are linked together
with links made from the same thickness metal
as the bars. The pendant and the swivel are
also connected with the same kind of links.</p>

<h3>SPOONS, SUGAR TONGS AND TEA
SCOOPS.</h3>


<p>These exercises are easily carried out after a little
experience. No steps are taken that have not already been
described, except in the case of forming the bowl of the spoon.
This is done by taking a piece of lead and making a depression
in it the size and shape of the bowl required. A piece
of hard wood is shaped on the end grain to fit the depression
made in the lead. The metal is placed over the depression
and the wood shape placed on top of the metal; it is then
driven into the form by using a hammer. This will give
the general shape of the bowl which may be trued up later
by sawing and filing.</p>

<h3>RIVETS.</h3>

<p>The making of rivets is quite important as it is impossible
to find in the market the variety in size and shape of
head that each piece of work demands. Where rivets with
a wire 1/8" or less are needed, they may be made as follows:
Take a piece of iron or steel A, <a href="#Page_109">Plate 50</a>, thicker than the
desired length of the rivet and drill a hole through it having
its diameter a little greater than the wire of the rivet. Take
a piece of copper wire of the required diameter and
about 1/8" longer than the thickness of the iron. Place the
wire in the hole and the iron on some smooth metal surface,
B. With a hammer make a burr of the wire that projects
above the iron. Then reverse the iron and drive out the
rivets. This gives what is shown at D. The rivet is then
cut off the required length, placed in position and headed up.
The head may be made conical, I, hemispherical, J, pyramidal,
K, or square, L, in shape. It may be headed up simply
with the hammer, or with a rivet header, M.</p>

<p>When necessary, the process may be reversed and the
head made first; but when made in this way, a rivet block is
needed to rest the head in while making the burr.</p>

<p>The rivet may be made more of a decorative feature
by sawing out of sheet metal some suitable design as shown
at P, Q, R. Drill a hole in the center the size of the rivet
and then use any ordinary rivet head. Nails may be made
by the same process, headed and pointed as at S and O.</p>

<h3>TO DRAW WIRE AND SMALL TUBING.</h3>

</div>
<div class="pmb1"></div>


<p>Cut a piece of copper the length required, having the
width about three times the diameter of the tube that is to
be made. The edges must first be made parallel by filing.
In a block of maple or some hard wood, with a wood file,
make a groove as shown at <a href="#Page_110">Figure 30</a>. Place the strip of
metal over the groove and, with a somewhat pointed hammer,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
drive the metal into it until it takes the shape of a V.
<a href="#Page_110">Figure 31 A</a>. Then place it on the flat part of the block and
strike on the edges with the hammer, turning them in until
they meet, as at B and C.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

  <span class="caption"><span style="font-size:.8em">
  Figure 32.</span><br />
  </span>
</div>
<div class="pmb1"></div>


<p>A draw plate is then placed in the vise, <a href="#Page_111">Figure 32</a>.
After pointing the tube a little, the end is placed in one of
the larger holes and drawn through. This will bring it
somewhat into shape. Repeat this operation by drawing
the tube through the hole the next smaller in size and so on
till the tube is of the diameter required.</p>

<p>Wire may be drawn in the same way. Rectangular,
triangular and square drawplates may be obtained as well
as circular ones.</p>


<h3>POLISHING.</h3>

<p>To polish work, a cloth or felt buff is placed on a lathe
or a polishing head. With a little cut-quick and rouge
objects may be brightened by holding them against the wheel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>The marking of work so that it will be known to whom
it belongs and doing it in a neat and workmanlike manner
is sometimes a problem. Using a gummed label with the
name written on it has been tried, but the labels frequently
come off. The name has been scratched with a sharp-pointed
tool, but it is not an easy thing to do and certainly does not
look well. The way described below however has proved
very satisfactory. Have each pupil design a little trade mark
of his own, and work it out on the end of a piece of tool
steel, 1/8 inch or 3/16 inch square, round or hexagonal. This
can be done by a little filing, perhaps the use of a drill if the
design should call for it, and a little emery paper to take off
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
all sharp edges. This serves as a stamp with which he may
mark all of his work. The instructor has a book with the
names of the pupils, and after each name he may stamp
this mark and thereby register it so that he may tell at
any time to whom work belongs.</p>


<p><a href="#Page_112">Figure 33</a> shows a stamp and a few suitable designs.</p>


<h3>COLORING.</h3>

<p>The most satisfactory color that can be given copper
is a bronze which comes naturally if left to come in contact
with varying atmospheres. If the object has a good
polished surface in the first place the color seems to become
richer as time goes on.</p>

<p>A color that is satisfactory in many cases is obtained
in the following way:</p>

<p>Place in a porcelain dish and bring to a boiling heat,
liver of sulphur, 1 oz., and water, 1 qt. Dip the object
to be colored in this solution while hot and then rinse in
clean water. This gives the object a very dark color.
Take a little powdered pumice stone on a piece of cloth
and rub over the surface lightly bringing the copper color
to the surface where desired.</p>

<p>A greenish color is given copper by submitting the
object to the fumes of spirits of ammonia.</p>

<p>Beautiful colors are obtained by heating the object to
different degrees, over a gas plate, but these results are
not permanent.</p>

<h3>ENAMELING.</h3>


<p>Enamel may be applied to metal objects and add a
great deal to their value and attractiveness if used sparingly.
The enamels most used are transparent and opaque; the
transparent reflects the color of the metal adding a great
deal of life to the work, the opaque gives color on the surface
only.</p>

<p>The process, as described in this chapter, touches but
the elementary stages of the art that are within the possibilities
of high school work and possibly the upper grammar
grades.</p>

<p>Enamel may be applied by any of the following
methods:</p>

<p>First: By covering the entire surface of the object
with enamel.</p>

<p>Second: By using a flat wire which is bent into sections
the shape of the design and soldered to the object;
the wire forms partitions to receive the enamel.</p>

<p>Third: By cutting away the design by the use of
engraving tools, making channels about 1/32 of an inch
deep to receive the enamel.</p>

<p>Fourth: By using a chasing tool either from the front
or from the back of the work, forming raised or sunken
partitions to receive the enamel.</p>

<p>The first and second methods are difficult ones, requiring
a great deal of experience in handling metal and enamel
to obtain satisfactory results.</p>

<p>The third and fourth methods are comparatively simple
and are within the possibilities of those for whom this
book is intended.</p>

<p>In the third method the design is first transferred to
the object by the use of carbon paper and then made more
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
permanent with a scratcher. The design is cut out with
the engraving tools, <a href="#Page_19">Figures 6</a>, <a href="#Page_115">34</a> and <a href="#Page_117">35</a>, about 1/32 of
an inch deep. All edges should be kept as smooth as possible
and the channels should be uniform in depth. For
convenience in holding, if the work is small, it may be
fastened to a little pitch or wax spread on a block, or it may
be placed on the pitch block as described under embossing
on page <a href="#Page_64">64</a>. The handle of the tool is held in the palm of
the hand, and the thumb, placed within an inch of the point,
serves as a guide while cutting,<a href="#Page_115">Figures 34</a> and <a href="#Page_117">35</a>. By
wriggling the tool a little from one side to the other,
greater progress is possible.</p>

<p>In the fourth method the design is transferred to either side
of the object. After placing it on a pitch block, depressions
may be made from the face or lines raised from the under side.</p>

<p>After the partitions have been formed, the object must
be thoroughly cleaned and brightened by dipping in a bath
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
of nitric acid. After dipping, which should be done quickly
on account of the rapid action of the acid on the metal, it
should be rinsed thoroughly in clean water. This process
removes all dirt and leaves the metal bright. After this
cleaning, the fingers should not touch any part of the object
that is to receive the enamel.</p>

<p>To prepare the enamel for application it must be ground.
First break it into small pieces with a hammer. To keep
it from flying about, it is well to roll it up in a piece of heavy
wrapping paper. It is then placed in a porcelain mortar and,
with a little water and a pestle, it is ground about as fine
as fine sand. The water is poured off and the enamel
rinsed several times in clean water until the milky substance
disappears. Unsatisfactory results often come from
lack of care in washing the enamel. After washing it is
removed from the mortar to a small saucer by the use of
a palette knife. While still wet, which allows its being
spread more easily, the enamel is applied to the object with
a soft hair brush.</p>

<p>All of the enameling suggested in this book may be
done with an ordinary blow-pipe or a Bunsen burner, but
more satisfactory results are obtained with a kiln.</p>

<p>To apply the process to a definite piece of work, the
steps necessary in enameling the Stamp Box cover on <a href="#Page_56">Plate 24</a>,
No. 3, will be taken up. It will be assumed that the box
is made, ready for the application of the design as shown
on the plate. The design is first transferred to the cover
and then cut away. It is cleaned with kerosene and dipped
in nitric acid as before explained. After being thoroughly
washed, it is ready for the enamel. In applying the enamel
care must be taken not to get particles outside of the channels.
After the moisture has evaporated and the enamel
has been fired it settles considerably so that this must be
allowed for by rounding it above the surface. After the
enamel has been applied, the strip that is soldered to the
under side of the cover must be protected from the heat
before firing, as the temperature required for fusing the
enamel is several times greater than that required for
soldering.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 372px;">
 <a name="Figure_35" id="Figure_35"></a>
  <img src="images/i_117.jpg" width="372" height="600" alt="Engraving." title="" />
  <span class="caption"><span style="font-size:.8em">
  Figure 35.</span><br />
  </span>
</div>
<div class="pmb1"></div>


<p>The soldering is protected by placing a paste
made of yellow ochre and water about the soldered joint
both inside and outside of the strip. The more of this clay
we bank about the joint the more protection there is. When
the above has been done, the object must be left in some
warm place until the moisture from both the enamel and the
clay is thoroughly evaporated. It is then ready for firing.
If the blow-pipe or the Bunsen burner is used, take a tripod
and place a piece of heavy iron netting over the top and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
place the object on top of the netting. The flame should
always be applied to the under side. Watch the enamel
as the firing goes on and when it settles and glazes the heat
should be withdrawn. The object should be allowed to
cool very slowly. Hurrying at this point only increases
chances for accidents. If, when cool, it is found that the
channels in places are not full of enamel, the object is again
cleaned in the nitric acid, more enamel applied, and fired
as at first. The cover is now ready to finish. The enamel
may be stoned down level with the top with an emery
stone, or it may be left just as it comes from the fire in the
first place. If stoned down, it is necessary to fire it again
just enough to give it a glazed surface.</p>

<p>The directions as given apply to either transparent or
opaque enamel; but, in addition to the above, when transparent
enamel is used, the surface to be enameled must
first receive a coating of flux to retain the transparency.
The flux is treated and applied just the same as the enamel
already described.</p>

enamel.</p>
